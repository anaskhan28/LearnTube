This is the official source of LearnTube 
When anyone wants to learn about a technology or wants to starts to learn something new, most probably he would be looking for it on YouTube. Why? because it is the best place for one to find videos and tutorials on any topic that they wish to learn for free. But the main drawback of learning from YouTube is that it's too much cluttered now and there are lot of videos on same topics which newbie gets overwhelmed at first to select which one to follow. With this project our aim is to organise the clutter in the YouTube and make it more approachable to find the resources from YouTube for all the newbies out there.

What our project does is it provides a platform where the users who have learnt a set of skills from YouTube can make a playlist of videos. The users who comes to learn can then search the topic they want to learn and the platform would provide these playlists as the output, not any standalone video. Its like spotify playlist that anyone can create and others can follow except here its for educational purpose. So this way the vast amount of videos that is cluttered in YouTube can be simplified for newbies. These newbies can then watch these playlists and then can decide whether it is good or bad and according we can use it to rank those playlists in the search.
